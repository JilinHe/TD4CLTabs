# TD4CLTabs
TD4CLTabs is a novel domain-specific table type classification dataset, which contains 15k table images (12k for training and 3k for the test) and their corresponding type labels obtained from ACL Anthology. It is from my master thesis topic supported by TUB and DFKI, namely, Towards a novel classification of table type in scholarly publications.
